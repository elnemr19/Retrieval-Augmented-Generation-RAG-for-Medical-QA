People with these conditions have hair that is unusually coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled. In some cases, the hair is also sparse. The woolly hair texture typically affects only scalp hair and is present from birth. Starting early in life, affected individuals also develop palmoplantar keratoderma, a condition that causes skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused.  Cardiomyopathy, which is a disease of the heart muscle, is a life-threatening health problem that can develop in people with keratoderma with woolly hair. Unlike the other features of this condition, signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy may not appear until adolescence or later. Complications of cardiomyopathy can include an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia), heart failure, and sudden death.  Keratoderma with woolly hair comprises several related conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms. Researchers have recently proposed classifying keratoderma with woolly hair into four types, based on the underlying genetic cause. Type I, also known as Naxos disease, is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, woolly hair, and a form of cardiomyopathy called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Type II, also known as Carvajal syndrome, has hair and skin abnormalities similar to type I but features a different form of cardiomyopathy, called dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Type III also has signs and symptoms similar to those of type I, including ARVC, although the hair and skin abnormalities are often milder. Type IV is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly and sparse hair, as well as abnormal fingernails and toenails. Type IV does not appear to cause cardiomyopathy.')"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Embedding and FAISS Vector

These episodes, sometimes referred to as asthma attacks, are triggered by irritation of the inflamed airways. In allergic asthma, the attacks occur when substances known as allergens are inhaled, causing an allergic reaction. Allergens are harmless substances that the body's immune system mistakenly reacts to as though they are harmful. Common allergens include pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. The immune response leads to the symptoms of asthma. Allergic asthma is the most common form of the disorder.  A hallmark of asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which means the airways are especially sensitive to irritants and respond excessively. Because of this hyperresponsiveness, attacks can be triggered by irritants other than allergens, such as physical activity, respiratory infections, or exposure to tobacco smoke, in people with allergic asthma.  An asthma attack is characterized by tightening of the muscles around the airways (bronchoconstriction), which narrows the airway and makes breathing difficult. Additionally, the immune reaction can lead to swelling of the airways and overproduction of mucus. During an attack, an affected individual can experience chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. Over time, the muscles around the airways can become enlarged (hypertrophied), further narrowing the airways.  Some people with allergic asthma have another allergic disorder, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Asthma is sometimes part of a series of allergic disorders, referred to as the atopic march. Development of these conditions typically follows a pattern, beginning with eczema (atopic dermatitis), followed by food allergies, then hay fever, and finally asthma. However, not all individuals with asthma have progressed through the atopic march, and not all individuals with one allergic disease will develop others.\"),\n Document(id='0da25158-b8af-4b13-95d8-905eecd3ca26', metadata={}, page_content='Question: What is (are) Asthma ?\\nAnswer: Asthma is a breathing disorder that affects the airways. People with this condition experience recurrent swelling and narrowing of the airways of the lungs which is associated with wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Most affected people have episodes of symptoms (\"asthma attacks\") followed by symptom-free periods; however, some may experience persistent shortness of breath in between attacks. Asthma is considered a complex or multifactorial condition that is likely due to a combination of multiple genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever or eczema. Having a family member with asthma is associated with an increased risk of developing the condition. Treatment generally includes various medications, both to prevent asthma attacks and to provide quick relief during an attack.'),\n Document(id='d8bb43ec-61b2-4d45-a9d9-1dfa515d2c23', metadata={}, page_content=\"Question: What is (are) Asthma ?\\nAnswer: Espaol\\n                \\nAsthma (AZ-ma) is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. The coughing often occurs at night or early in the morning.\\n                \\nAsthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. In the United States, more than 25 million people are known to have asthma. About 7million of these people are children.\\n                \\nOverview\\n                \\nTo understand asthma, it helps to know how the airways work. The airways are tubes that carry air into and out of your lungs. People who have asthma have inflamed airways. The inflammation makes the airways swollen and very sensitive. The airways tend to react strongly to certain inhaled substances.\\n                \\nWhen the airways react, the muscles around them tighten. This narrows the airways, causing less air to flow into the lungs. The swelling also can worsen, making the airways even narrower. Cells in the airways might make more mucus than usual. Mucus is a sticky, thick liquid that can further narrow the airways.\\n                \\nThis chain reaction can result in asthma symptoms. Symptoms can happen each time the airways are inflamed.\\n                \\nAsthma\\n                \\n\\n                \\nSometimes asthma symptoms are mild and go away on their own or after minimal treatment with asthma medicine. Other times, symptoms continue to get worse.\\n                \\nWhen symptoms get more intense and/or more symptoms occur, you're having an asthma attack. Asthma attacks also are called flareups or exacerbations (eg-zas-er-BA-shuns).\\n                \\nTreating symptoms when you first notice them is important. This will help prevent the symptoms from worsening and causing a severe asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.\\n                \\nOutlook\\n                \\nAsthma has no cure. Even when you feel fine, you still have the disease and it can flare up at any time.\\n                \\nHowever, with today's knowledge and treatments, most people who have asthma are able to manage the disease. They have few, if any, symptoms. They can live normal, active lives and sleep through the night without interruption from asthma.\\n                \\nIf you have asthma, you can take an active role in managing the disease. For successful, thorough, and ongoing treatment, build strong partnerships with your doctor and other health care providers.\"),\n Document(id='25aa3bf0-5d8e-428e-9ad3-5294dfdace1c', metadata={}, page_content=\"Question: Who is at risk for Asthma? ?\\nAnswer: Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood.

Genetics: Individuals with a family history of asthma are more likely to develop the condition themselves, indicating a genetic component to the disease.\n\n2. Allergens: Common allergens such as pollen, mold, dust mites, and pet dander can trigger an immune response in the airways, leading to inflammation and asthma symptoms.\n\n3. Respiratory infections: Viral respiratory infections, such as the common cold or flu, can cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways, resulting in asthma symptoms.\n\n4. Exposure to pollutants: Environmental pollutants, such as tobacco smoke, chemical fumes, and air pollution, can irritate the airways and worsen asthma symptoms.\n\n5. Physical activity: Exercise-induced asthma occurs when vigorous physical activity triggers an immune response in the airways, causing them to narrow and result in asthma symptoms.\n\n6. Occupational hazards: Exposure to certain occupational hazards, such as chemicals or dust in the workplace, can worsen asthma symptoms in some individuals.\n\n7. Stress and allergens: Emotional stress and reactions to allergens can also exacerbate asthma symptoms.\n\nIn conclusion, asthma is caused by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, with common triggers including allergens, respiratory infections, pollutants, physical activity, occupational hazards, stress, and reactions to allergens.

Genetic predisposition: Some people exhibit a genetic tendency to develop asthma, often called atopy. This likelihood of developing asthma often exists in individuals who have one or both parents with the condition.\n\n2. Environmental factors:\n   a. Atopic history: Individuals with a personal or family history of allergies such as hay fever or eczema are more likely to develop asthma. \n   b.

Genetic Predisposition: A genetic tendency toward atopy (having an increased likelihood of developing allergies) can be inherited from parents, especially when asthma is prevalent in the family.\n\n2. Early Life Factors: In early biological development, factors such as respiratory infections or exposure to specific allergens can predispose the immune system toward an asthmatic response.\n\n3. Atopy: If atopy isn't managed during critical periods of immune system development, it can increase the probability of asthma.\n\n4. Environmental Irritants and Allergens: Contact with irritants like tobacco smoke, and pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold can exacerbate or trigger asthma by provoking the immune system.\n\n5.

Some people may be born with a genetic predisposition to developing asthma, which is referred to as having an atopic background. Atopic means having a genetically predisposed tendency to develop an allergic response. Environmental factors may also play a significant role. These can include exposure to allergens (such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander), respiratory infections early in life, and irritants like tobacco smoke. Certain respiratory infections during childhood, especially when the immune system is still developing, can also contribute to the onset of asthma and may also increase the risk of allergic sensitization. Lifestyle factors, such as diet and exposure to pollution, are also considered to potentially influence asthma risk. Asthma is considered a complex condition with multiple triggers and causes, and even identical twins do not always both develop asthma. Other asthma triggers include exercising in cold air, stress, or changes in weather. The \"Hygiene Hypothesis\" also suggests that reduced exposure to various infections during early childhood may contribute to an increased prevalence of asthma since the immune system might not develop as robustly, potentially making individuals more prone to allergies and asthma.\n\n🤖 Improved approach:\n Asthma is a complex chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the airways, which leads to episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. While the exact cause of asthma is not fully understood, various factors are thought to contribute, including genetic predisposition (atopy) and environmental influences. Individuals with a family history of asthma or allergies such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and eczema (atopic dermatitis) have an increased risk.\n\nThe development of asthma may be multifactorial:\n\n1. **Genetic Factors**: There is an inherited component called atopy, which increases the susceptibility to developing airway sensitivity when exposed to certain allergens.\n\n2. **Environmental Triggers**: Exposure to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, mold, animal dander, and tobacco smoke can precipitate an asthma attack. Different triggers can vary by geographical location and individual sensitivities.\n\n3. **Infections**: Respiratory infections during early childhood, particularly viral ones, may play a role in the development of asthma, though their exact impact is not precisely known.\n\n4. **The Hygiene Hypothesis**: Some researchers propose that too clean an environment, in conjunction with less frequent infections during childhood, can lead to a less trained immune system. This under-experience with pathogens might result in a more reactive immune response to allergens, contributing to the onset of asthma.\n\n5. **Lifestyle and other factors**: Smoking or exposure to pollution and occupational irritants can exacerbate asthma symptoms. Lifestyle choices, including diet and physical activity, may also influence the condition.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma, efforts to reduce contact with known triggers, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and management of atopic conditions are essential. Although there is no absolute cure for asthma, treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and immunotherapy can alleviate symptoms, improve lung function, and help manage the condition over the long term.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Save the FAISS vector store","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"faiss_db.save_local(\"faiss_medquad_index\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-27T19:13:07.704598Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-27T19:13:07.705084Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-27T19:13:07.815784Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-27T19:13:07.705042Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-27T19:13:07.815201Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Inference","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install gradio","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-27T19:06:10.874672Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-27T19:06:10.875388Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-27T19:06:20.576484Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-27T19:06:10.875363Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-27T19:06:20.575700Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.
